# browser-bypasses
a collection of different methods of bypassing content filters<p>
pro tip: to change the site in the bypass, just change https://anura.pro to https://whatever <p>
also, data urls only fetch **static** html data. If you want to change the base64 (the random jumble of letters) to fetch something else, use the encoder file. <p>
none of these can get past *network-level* filters, except for the proxy html, and thats only if the proxy is only blocket by something like a management extension, but not the network filter.
